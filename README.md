# TensorFlow-Movie-Recommender-Collaborative-Filtering-Guide

This notebook walks through the process of building a collaborative filtering recommender system for movies using TensorFlow. Below are the key steps covered in the notebook:

Notation: Provides an overview of the notation used in collaborative filtering.
Recommender Systems: Explains the concept of collaborative filtering recommender systems.
Movie ratings dataset: Describes the movie ratings dataset used for training the recommender system.
Collaborative filtering learning algorithm: Details the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and the cost function.
Exercise 1: Implements the cost function using for loops.
Learning movie recommendations: Trains the collaborative filtering model using TensorFlow's custom training loop.
Recommendations: Makes movie recommendations based on the trained model and user preferences.
The notebook demonstrates how to implement collaborative filtering, train the model, and make personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings. It uses TensorFlow for model implementation and optimization, making it efficient and scalable for larger datasets.
